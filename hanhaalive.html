IMPACT -- Device configured for Motion Continues mode and Impact counter has exceed Movement threshold configuration within the Movement Interval check, otherwise it will wait until the Stationary Interval expires when no movement detected. 
MOTION_STARTED -- Device configured for Motion Start/Stop mode and Impact counter has exceed Movement threshold configuration while device was already Idle or Stopped.
MOTION_STOPPED -- Device configured for Motion Start/Stop mode and Impact counter hasn't exceed Movement threshold within the Idle Interval check. This means device was Idling hence STOPPED event generated.
HEARTBEAT  --  Heartbeat event is only for BeWired Devices.  Heartbeat is the event when the ignition is off and the device is stationary.
GPIO ON -- event is only for BeWired Devices.  GPIO ON  is the event when the ignition is on and the device is transmitting on the “ignition Interval”
GPIO OFF  -- event is only for BeWired Devices.  GPIO OFF  is the last ignition event when the ignition was turned off.
Frame - Frame Counter of a particular record
RSSI  (Received Signal Strength Indicator). A measurement of the power present in a received radio signal.  With regards to the RSSI in the  Bluetooth beacons, this is converted to distance from sending device:
Beacons 2ft from Sending Device - RSSI = -52 to -66 DISTANCE = 2.50 to .63 (8.2ft-2ft). 
Beacons 35ft from Sending Device - RSSI = -69 to -89 DISTANCE = 35.44 to 3.55 (116ft-18.2ft). 
Beacons 75ft from Sending Device - RSSI = -81 to -92 DISTANCE = 50.12 to 14.13 (164.4ft-46.9ft)

Movement Counter:  The movement sensitivity of the device while in motion.  
THE MOVEMENT COUNTER IS A MOTION SETTING TO DETERMINE A MOVEMENT COUNT OF 1 IS .3 G IMPACT WITHIN 32 MILLISECONDS.  **IE. IF INTERVAL IS SET TO 5 MINUTES AND MOVEMENT COUNTER IS SET TO 2, THE DEVICE WILL NEED TO DETECT 2 .3G IMPACTS WITHIN 5 MINUTES FOR THE DEVICE TO TRANSMIT DATA ON MOTION.
Stationary Interval: Timed report while the device is not in motion.

BeSol
-Time based
-Motion (Trip) - Which includes a Trip Start and Trip Stop Record


Motion Trip  (Start/Stop):
NOTE:  Devices with Firmware Version 1.4.2 + as of December 1st 2018 have an additional Motion Based Configuration feature:  For Motion Based Configuration, there are 2 types of settings: Motion Start-Stop and Motion Continuous:
For Motion Start-Stop, the device will only send a report when the device starts and then when it stops.  For example, the idle interval setting set to 15 minutes means the device will report 15 minutes once it stops moving. The movement threshold is the motion sensitivity of the device.  A setting of 10 means it will need to detect or not detect a minor motion 10 times within 15 minutes.  The stationary interval set to 12 hours would mean the device will send a record every 12 hours when not moving.  





For Motion Continuous, the device will send data every 15 minutes when in motion.
NOTE 1:  Existing firmware version must be 1.6.15 and above to be able to set Motion Configuration. 
NOTE 2: Motion Configuration should only be sent if the device battery level is 3.8 volts or higher to prevent the battery from draining during the configuration.

The device has an accelerometer on board that it uses to measure g forces.  A movement threshold is defined by us as a certain measured g force over time.  For the device to break the movement threshold you set (x) it would have to go over the defined g force/time setting x times
Each x min interval the device will go into a listening state - if it senses the motion threshold has been exceeded, it will increment a counter.  If the counter is greater than x by end of x min it will wake up and send a report.  If it does not sense motion counter > x it will continue to listen for another x minutes (keeping the value of the counter).
This listening will continue every x minutes.  There is a secondary timer that is the stationary timer.  If there is no motion (Movement threshold > x) in x min it will expire and it will force the device to wake up and send a report.  This secondary timer will reset every time you send a motion report.
Motion with Sensor Configuration






Add start time for timer configuration:
For timer configuration, the user can set a start time, please see the picture below. Please note: In order to set start time, the interval should be equal and greater than 1 hour and can be divided by 24 hours


For firmware 1.6.14 above, motion start/stop has been changed to 'Motion', by default enabling "continuous motion".

BeWired
-Time based with Ignition
-Motion Trip with Ignition
-Sensor Integration temp probe

The Wired devices have a configurable Initial interval feature.  This feature is to set how frequent the device will transmit when the ignition is detected.












Disable GPS Feature
When devices are going into storage and not being used, recommended configuration is Timer Based with 24 hour interval and Disable GPS selected.  










The Temperature Sensor will need to be selected if the temperature probe is used:










BeMini
-Time based
-Motion (Trip)
-Leash Mode
The BeMini has a Leashed Based Feature.  By adding the WiFi BSSIDs, the mini will not use GPS allowing the device to preserve battery Life.  GPS Location will be used from the Wifi Location.  This will determine the Wifi Geofence.  When the device detects that it is within the Wifi Geofence, the onleash interval will activate and the device will transmit only every 24 hours as per the on Leash interval.  Please note to endure the BSSID/MAC ID is added as follows: ##:##:##:##:##:##



Leash Based Configuration Definitions:

GPS waiting for fix (Max wait time) - The maximum amount of time a device will wait for valid gps.
 After GPS-Fix Improvement (Max wait time) - Once device finds a fix, maximum waiting time device will stay on to increase GPS accuracy.
 OnLeash interval - Reporting time when in WiFi range.
 OffLeash interval(sec) - Reporting time when out of WiFi range.  Time Based feature.  (note: device will continue to transmit regardless if movement/no movement until device enters back into WiFi).
 Scan interval stationary(sec) - Amount of time the device scans within WiFi range when not in motion to confirm the device is still in a WiFi range.  (Internal Feature)
 Motion thresh -  Movement threshold when device is in motion.
 WiFi Geofence - BSSID needs to be added for each device.  Format is:  ##:##:##:##:##:##






Remote Commands:
Hard reset: manufacture reset, all settings..
Soft reset: normal soft reset and internal registers.
Hibernate: Used to put the device to deep-sleep mode to preserve battery life with no reporting updates. The device will wake up and start transmitting again once the device detects light.



Data Usage:
1 Transmission  = 150 Bytes
4  Pings x 150 Bytes = 650 Bytes x 30 days = 18000 Bytes -> 17 KBytes ~ 0.2MB
8 Pings x 150 Bytes = 1200 Bytes x 30 days = 36000 Bytes -> 35 KBytes ~ 0.35MB
12 Pings x 150 Bytes = 1800 Bytes x 30 days = 54000 Bytes -> 52 KBytes ~ 0.6MB 
24 Pings x 150 Bytes = 3600 Bytes x 30 days = 108000 Bytes -> 108 KBytes ~ 1.08MB 


Configuring Multiple Beacons

Select multiple devices  from the Beacons Tab




Right click and select Edit.  The selected devices will now be visible.  Tags can be created for the multiple devices selected and also the configuration can be configured for the selected devices.



Import Templates are available from the Administration menu.

Multiple devices can be configured at the same time using the Import tool. Select Add and then select the csv file to import from. Use template Beacon_Import_Template_Config.csv in order to update batch configuration.





The Data Column GPS FIX will indicate the GPS Record Type: 
Valid 1 - The device transmitted with a valid GPS record
Valid 2 - The device did not attempt to get a GPS fix as the motion of device indicated the device did not move – its assuming the previous valid GPS position.
Invalid 3 – The device attempted to get a GPS record but could not – The location will display the last position that was valid or the Cell tower location using the GPS Assist Feature.  This is because the device could be blocked from the sky or the device could be indoors.
Valid 4 – The device is using the closest WiFi Location (Note: Only BeMini) **Wi-Fi 40 meters is the standard consumer grade router for accuracy. we have seen other routers we pickup that go a farther range like 80 or 120 meters but those are exemptions and rare.  

SKIP GPS FEATURE ADDED JANUARY 2020
Normally the device will fetch GPS info every time after the device wakes up. If user selects "Skip GPS" option, then the device won't fetch GPS info after wakes up. The purpose to do so is to save power and time(Firmware fetch GPS will consumer more power and takes up to 3 minutes). This is a good option for the devices in door or do not move.









Note:  Cellular device must have valid GPS and a clear view of the sky for accurate location reporting.  If a device does not have a valid GPS, click on the Map Option located in the top right corner of the map and select Network to view the closest Cell Tower that is communicating with the device.

Cellular beacons will also display the Firmware Version from the beacon page.  Please note that this feature is not applicable to the Blue Tooth Beacon.


From the Dashboard, Show Column “Tags” and then sort the Tags column to see the tagged beacons grouped together.


Administration

Groups – MIOT
The Groups feature allows you to Group devices together by asset type and then assign users to the specific Groups so that when the users log in, they only see the devices assigned to their Group.
Create a New Group. Select Group from Administration.



Add a new Group.




Name the Group appropriately then click on Save.


Right click on the new group and select Edit.




From the Beacons Tab add devices to the Group and Save.


From the Users Tab Select the users that will have access to the devices and assigned to the group and select Save.


Optional, from the Basic Info Tab, Select the Choose parent Group if there’s a group created that has all the devices assigned to it. 

Rules – MIOT
Create a Rule and then edit the rule to select the conditions of the sensors. Notifications can be activated and users selected to receive the email alerts.

The Legacy Alert Rule is used to send email alerts based on selected thresholds.  Note:  Selecting All beacons will include any additional devices that are added to the account on future orders



Additional rule types such as Start/Stop and Trip are used to activate Start and stop and/or Trip Events.  


The results of activating these Rule Events are found under Dashboard/Events


The Dormant Rule is used to activate the Dormant feature in the Schedule Reports.






Sites and Geozones
The Geozone feature is only functional for MIOT Devices and Not Bluetooth beacons. 
Here are the steps to create a Geozone:

Step 1.  Add a new site 


Step 2.  Name the Geofence
Step 3.  
-Select Capture Stops (Optional if you would like to see the In/Out notifications in the Dashboard Location Column and Dashboard Events Report).
-Select GPS Assisted (Optional if you would like to include the Cell Tower location as a stop).
-Select Visible on Map (Optional if you would like to have the Geozone visible on the map).
Step 4. Insert address or Latitude and Longitude coordinates in the Address Search Tool located top left or navigate to the location by dragging the map using the left mouse click and using the + (Zoom in) and – (Zoom Out) Feature.
Step 5.  Draw the geofence using the Polygon, square or circle drawing feature.  
Step 6.  Click Save.


Email notifications can be created for Zone In and/or Zone out events from the Edit Sites and Geozone page.  Email notifications can also be configured for Bluetooth Beacon transmitter zones.


The next scheduled report will now display the name of the Geozone in the Geozone Column (GeoZone Location) and indicate if the device was in or out of the Geozone




The Dashboard Events Report will also display the devices, timestamp, In/Out events and address:


There are several types of Events Report
Dwell and GeoZone – Displays both In/Out and all Stop Begin Stop End Events.
Dwell – Displays only Stop Begin and Stop End Events.
Geozone – Displays only In/Out of Geozone Events
Trips – Displays the Trip Start and Trip End Events



Note: To Activate the Start Stop or Trip Event Report, the Start Stop or Trip Rule needs to be created:

Add a new Rule and select the Start Stop Rule.

Default Condition is 200 Meters

Note:  Requirement for Trips Event / Report Feature
Recommended for BeSol devices with firmware version 1.6.15+ 
Configuration: Motion (Start-Continuous-Stop) Idle: 15min Interval:12/24hrs


In order to enable Trip Event, feature a Trip Rule needs to be enabled (at least one for each account)

Trip Rule can be configured for “All beacons” assigned to the account or for specific Beacons if not all beacons are applicable. More features will be added to this feature to simplify management in the upcoming sprints.




Trip feature consists of two events: Trip Start linked to device Motion Start message and Trip End linked to device Motion Stop message, however there is a slight difference in terms of how location of the event is calculated. 



Once the Trip Event data has been filtered out, it can be downloaded in the Trip Report view as per format below

Users
The new users feature allows you to add additional users.  Username is the users email address.  Please use lower case.  For the role please select administrator.

The group alerts are accessible through Administration/Groups and then edit Group.  Click on Administration, select Groups and then right-click on a Group to edit the group.  The Alert can now be configured for a group.  

NEW FEATURE RELEASE NOTES
1.1 Beacons 
The Beacons view displays devices in your database and allows you to add new devices or to modify the settings of existing ones.
What is the end-of-life voltage level when devices stop working?


BeTen (2AA non-rechargeable battery) 
Voltage level is affected by temperature, however, in room temperature it works in this range of 3.65 to 3.5. If the temperature is low and below 0 the voltage range will be lower. This is how lithium batteries operate.
BeSol (3000 mAh rechargeable LiPo)
Voltage range 4.2v - 3.5V which is the cutoff for the device to be active. 
BeMini - Battery is drained at 3.35v


What happens when a device can’t find a network? How often does it retry? 

If a device fails to connect it will save data in the buffer and go to sleep and will try again the next schedule (depending on configuration)

1.1.2 Device Configuration
1.1.2	Time 
Recommend configuration 
Battery devices when once or a few times updates a day are required. Typically for equipment that are stationary most of the time and occasionally move.
1.1.2	Motion Continuous 
Recommend configuration 
Solar devices when high-resolution data points are required while equipment is constantly in motion 

Example configuration 

As the equipment is moving while the device is sleeping, per active/inactive thresholds, device will detect movement and increment impact counter without connecting to the network. Per Motion Interval device will wake up and check if the impact counter is >= movement threshold. If that’s the case device will record an Impact event will try to update GPS, connect to the network, and sends Impact event. Otherwise the device will wake per Stationary Interval and record and send Update event. 

Updates: 0 value means no event generated hence no update to server, 3 represent Impact, 1 represent stationary Update. 

1.1.3	Motion Start-Stop 
Recommend configuration 
Battery and/or Solar devices when initial start and last stop is required for equipment that are constantly in motion, but their trip is not important, recommended 

A Motion Start is recorded when the device starts moving, impact counter is >=movement threshold. A stop is recorded when the device hasn’t recorded any impact for Idle Interval.



Updates: 0 value means no updates, 4/5 represent Motion Start / Motion Stop, 1 represent stationary Update. 

1.1.4	Motion Start-Impact-Stop
Recommend configuration starting with new firmware 1.6.15
Battery and/or Solar devices when initial start and last stop is required for equipment that is constantly in motion, but their trip is not important, recommended 
A Motion Start (start) is recorded when the device starts moving, impact counter is >=movement threshold. A Motion Stop (stop) is recorded when the device hasn’t recorded any impact during Idle Interval. An Impact (motion) is recorded when any impact is recorded during Idle Interval. 


1.1.5	BLE Gateway configuration
BLE gateway operates independently of solar devices. It has its own configuration in terms of wakeup, scan and storing discovered BLE data. 
Wakeup Interval: It determines the interval (in seconds) how often the device will wake up for scanning BLE Tag/Sensors in proximity. Recommended to be set to multiple of 30seconds i.e. 60, 90 or 120 etc.…. In the example below device will wake up every 2 mins to scan for BLE sensors.
Scan Duration: Duration for which device will scan for BLE device in proximity. Recommended 15s and higher but not too high as it has implications with battery consumption.  In the example below 
Scan Window: Not applicable, for admins only if required.
Scan Method: Depending on use cases, the configuration can be set as follows: 
Store/Forward: 0 -Every time BLE wakes up it will store scanned BLE records, from assigned Beacons, in memory to send when a cellular update happens. Scan duration may depend on how many beacons are assigned to ensure the duration is enough to scan all beacons in proximity. 
Last Scan: 1 – It stores the last scan data, from assigned Beacons, and sends with other cellular updates. Its recommended if beacons are used for proximity or onboard presence only and sensor data is not required. 

All beacons: 2 – Similar to Last Scan but does not require BLE Tag assignment. In this configuration, Scan duration might need to be set long enough to scan for a large number of beacons if necessary. This configuration consumes lots of data and power/battery consumption hence needs to be used with caution. 



Note: 
It’s important to know that BLE data will be transmitted only when the device has an event to transmit i.e. in this example BLE data will update only when devices moves every 15 mins or every 24 hrs. when stationary. 
BeSol and Beten Device has the capacity to store 24 records on board (store and forward) when the device is out of coverage  and then the records will be sent when in coverage
Bemini has the capacity to store 30 records with the next version (Q4 2022) increased to 100.

1.1.8  INSTALLATION 
BeWhere devices are shipped with a default configuration of 1 report every 24 hours to preserve battery life.  Once the devices are ready to be installed you can change the configuration or email support@bewhere.com and we will change it for you.

Please ensure you install the devices with a clear view of the sky for best results.  Solar powered devices need to be installed on the asset so it can get direct sunlight. 

The GPS Sensor is located at the top of the device near the light sensor.  The cellular antenna is also located on the side of the device with the serial number label.  Do not mount this side of the device against metal.  Mounting the device with the GPS directed towards the sky will give the best results.  

Battery powered devices do not require to be installed with a view of the sky but they should also not be mounted against or below metal.  Mount the device with the GPS directed toward the sky and please try to leave several inches of the device clear from metal above and beside the device.

The device is water resistant but please do not pressure wash the device.




BeMini
Device default configuration is blank. BeMini in this state will not update but stay in "Ready State" In order to make BeMini update
set the configuration and,
press the button and hold for 10 seconds.
 This is how the BeMini works:
Mini is away from WIFI = will see GPS (valid 1) or not and use tower location (invalid 3)​
Mini is in range of WIFI = ​ device will try GPS if it is invalid it will use Wifi (valid 4)
When GPS fails and no WIFI around, then it will be invalid(3) at which point you only have cell id as location data
Mini is not moving and within WIFI still - Mini will attempt GPS on every report besides initial message.
Then goes back to option 1 or 2.
You will never see Valid 2 with the BeMini.
      4.	Battery is drained at 3.35v. Suggested Notification Rule to be set to 3.60v for Low Battery Alerts
      5. Currently the options reported through ‘GPS Fix’ are as follows:
1.	Valid(1) – valid GPS fix achieved;
2.	Valid(2) – in motion-based tracking, indicates the device has not moved since last update uses the last valid GPS fix (ie to preserve battery that would be required to reacquire the same GPS); You will never see Valid 2 with the BeMini.
3.	Invalid(3) -  GPS not available, reverting to tower (Cell ID) location;
4.	Valid(4) – GPS not available, using closest Wi-Fi AP’s to resolve location.
**W.r.t Wi-Fi 40 meters is the standard consumer grade router for accuracy, we have seen other routers we pickup that go farther range like 80 or 120 meters but those are exemptions and rare.  




Similar to iPhones and Android phones, the BeMini detects the MAC addresses of the closest Wi-Fi access points, and sends the closest in the ‘Network’ field below (in addition with information about the tower it is reporting through):


When Wi-Fi is used for location, within the ‘Network’ field, everything in the string beyond the text “assisted:” applies.


BSSID means Broadcast SSID which is the MAC address of the Wi-Fi AP equipment. When you open your phone and look at Wi-Fi networks around you, those names are the SSID’s.    To be clear, we do not connect to the Wi-Fi – the device simply recognizes the presence of nearby Wi-Fi access points to use for location purposes.    


Total Run Time/Engine hours is available from the BeMini.  The device will need to be hardwired and the power cable will need to be wired to ignition on/off in order to capture the total run time.  Run time data is also available in Geotab Engine measurements.
When wiring the BeMini with the power adapter, extra data will populate in your dashboard.
1.Ignition on/off (similar to BeWired)
2.Engine Run Time


See Below each sensor data and how is mapped to Geotab for each device.
